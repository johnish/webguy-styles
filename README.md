This has user style sheets that I have written. It uses the Stylus browser extension.

Install the Stylus extension by Stylus Team stylus.openstyles
      Chrome https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne
      FireFox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/

Add a the user style - you can find more information and instructions on how to do that by reading the information on the plugin.

Happy Browsing!
